* LEN
Checks the length of a string or array.\\
For multidimensional arrays, LEN returns the total number of items in the array.
There is no way to find the number of dimensions in an array, or to check the size of a specific dimension.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
LEN string$ OUT leng​th%
LEN array[] OUT len​gth%
#+END_SRC

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT LEN("test") '4
DIM A[7]
PRINT LEN(A) '7
DIM B[4,3]
PRINT LEN(B) '12
