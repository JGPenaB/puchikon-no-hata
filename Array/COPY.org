* COPY
Copies data between arrays or strings.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
COPY dest_array[] [, dest_start%], source_array[] [[, source_start%], source_length%]
COPY dest_array[] [, dest_start%], source_label$ [, source_length%]
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| dest_array[] | The array/string to copy *to* |
| dest_start% | The starting position in dest_array |
| source_array[] | The array/string to copy *from* |
| source_label$ | The DATA label to copy from |
| source_start% | The position in source_array to start copying from |
| source_length% | The number of items to copy |

=dest_array= will be extended if there isn't enough room for the data.

** Examples
Copying between arrays:
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
DIM A[10]
DIM B[0]
COPY B,A 'copy data from A to B
?LEN(B) '10
#+END_SRC
Reading DATA into an array:
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
DIM A[3]
COPY A,@TEST
@TEST
DATA 10,20,30
#+END_SRC
