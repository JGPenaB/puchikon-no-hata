* MPHOST
System variable. Contains the ID of the local multiplayer host system. =-1= if multiplayer is not enabled.

The host system always has an ID of =0=, but you should still use =MPHOST= just in case.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
MPSTART 2," "
IF MPHOST==MPLOCAL THEN PRINT "HOST"
#+END_SRC
