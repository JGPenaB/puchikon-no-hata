* Setting up contributing from a terminal
Install git.  Find another guide if you're not sure how to do this.

(Hint: it's probably just ~apt-get install git~)

Fork the repository on github (the button in the top right)

** Outside contributor group:
Clone the forked repository:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/puchikon-no-hata.git
cd puchikon-no-hata
git remote add upstream https://github.com/y-ack/puchikon-no-hata.git
git checkout -b yournamedocs
#+end_src
This will create a local git directory called ~puchikon-no-hata/~ in the current directory
we also need to make sure changes from the 'upstream' repository are considered when pulling, thus the remote add.
and also umm making the actual branch 'yournamedocs' lol

Set your name if you haven't.
#+begin_src bash
git config --global user.name "cool guy"
#+end_src

usual commit process:
#+begin_src bash
git pull
# do your edits
git add . # from base directory if necessary
git status # if you want to see the staged changes
git commit -m "a helpful commit message"

git push origin yournamedocs
#+end_src

and finally open a pull request on github

** If you are an approved contributor
I think it's a little easier?
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/y-ack/puchikon-no-hata.git
cd puchikon-no-hata
git config --global user.name "cool guy"
#+end_src
#+begin_src bash
git pull
# edits
git add
git commit -m "commit message"

git push
#+end_src
