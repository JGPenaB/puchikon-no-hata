* RND
Returns a random integer from 0 to a specified maximum (exclusive), using one of the [[RANDOMIZE.org][randomizer channels]].

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
RND [ channel%, ] range% OUT value%
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| parameter | description |
|-----------+-------------|
| channel%  | randomizer channel to use; 0 if omitted |
| range%    | the number of values to choose from |


** Examples
Print a random number from 1 to 6:
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT RND(6)+1
#+END_SRC

# ! IF VERSION DIFFERENCES EXIST !
# use the headings below.  Include bugs.
** Version Information
# include this table even if there is only one entry
+ [[#320][3.2.0]]
+ [[#321][3.2.1]]
+ [[#40][Switch 4.0]]
*** 3.0.0
