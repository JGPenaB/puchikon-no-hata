* ABS
Returns the absolute value of a number (basically, this means removing the ~-~ sign).\\
~ABS(NaN)~ is ~NaN~.  ~ABS(-2147483648)~ is ~-2147483648~ due to the size of the integer space.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
ABS number OUT absolute_value
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT ABS(10) '10
PRINT ABS(-10) '10
PRINT ABS(-1.5) '1.5
#+END_SRC
