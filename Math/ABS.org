* ABS
Returns the absolute value of a number (basically, this means removing the =-= sign).\\
=ABS(NaN)= is =NaN=.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
ABS number# OUT absolute_value#
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT ABS(10) '10
PRINT ABS(-10) '10
#+END_SRC
