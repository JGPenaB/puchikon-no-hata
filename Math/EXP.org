* EXP
Returns a power of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)][e]]/.

Eqivilant to =POW(2.7182818284590451, exponent#)=.\\
The exponent is optional and defaults to 1, so =EXP()= returns /e/.

=EXP(999)= is the shortest way to get infinity.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
EXP [exponent#] OUT power#
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| parameter | description |
|-----------+-------------|
| exponent# | Any number. Defaults to 1. |

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
E = EXP()
PRINT EXP(12)
PRINT POW(E,12)
#+END_SRC
