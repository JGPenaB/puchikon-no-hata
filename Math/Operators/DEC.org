* DEC
Subtracts a value from a variable.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
DEC number_variable [, amount]
#+END_SRC

=DEC variable, amount= is a shorter way of writing =variable = variable - amount= (similar to =variable -=​ amount= in other languages).
=amount= is 1 if omitted.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
X=13
DEC X
PRINT X '12
DEC X,10
PRINT X '2
#+END_SRC
