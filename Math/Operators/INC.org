* INC
Adds a value to a variable. Works on numbers and strings.\\

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
INC number_variable [, amount]
INC string_variable$, string$
#+END_SRC

=INC variable, amount= is a shorter way of writing =variable = variable + amount= (similar to =variable +=​ amount= in other languages).
=amount= is 1 if omitted.

When used on strings, =INC= works the same as =PUSH= (but slightly faster). Either way is more efficient than =+= because they modify the string rather than making a copy.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
X=13
INC X
PRINT X '14

S$="abc"
INC S$,"defg"
PRINT S$ 'abcdefg
#+END_SRC
