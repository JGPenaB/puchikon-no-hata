* ROUND

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell

ROUND integer% OUT integer%
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

** Examples

PRINT ROUND(6.2) '6
PRINT ROUND(10.5) '10
PRINT ROUND(-2.5) '-3
#+END_SRC
