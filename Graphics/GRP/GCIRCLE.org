* GCIRCLE
Draw a circle, arc, or sector.\\
[[http://kland.smilebasicsource.com/i/jipob.png]]

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
GCIRCLE center_x%, center_y%, radius% [, color%]
GCIRCLE center_x%, center_y%, radius%, start_angle%, end_angle% [, sector_flag% [, color%]]
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| center_x%, center_y% | Center position |
| radius% | Radius. If 0, nothing is drawn. |
| color% | Color |
| start_angle%, end_angle% | Range of arc to draw, in degrees |
| sector_flag% | If not 0, lines will be drawn from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the arc. |

Arc is always drawn clockwise from start_angle% to end_angle%, measured from the X+ axis.

# if the output is nontrivial or has interesting properties:
| Output    | Description       |
|-----------+-------------------|
| color%    | blood coagulation |
